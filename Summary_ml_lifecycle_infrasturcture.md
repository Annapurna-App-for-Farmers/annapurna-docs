ML lifecycle includes business goal identification, problem framing, data processing, model development, deployment, monitoring.


### Complete ML Lifecycle Stages
1. **Data Pipeline Development**  
2. **Model Development & Training**  
3. **Model Validation & Testing**  
4. **Model Deployment (API Serving)**  
5. **Monitoring & Observability**  
6. **Continuous Training/Retraining**  
7. **User Interaction System**

## Infrastructure Requirements by Stage

### 1️⃣ **Data Pipeline Development**
**Components Needed:**  
- **Storage:**  
  - Data lakes (AWS S3/MinIO) - Raw data storage ($0.023/GB-month)  
  - Feature stores (Hopsworks/Feast) - Processed features ($200+/month)  
- **Compute:**  
  - Batch processing (Spark/Dask clusters) - $0.15/hr per core  
  - Stream processing (Kafka/Flink) - $0.11/hr per MBps  

---

### 2️⃣ **Model Development & Training**
**Components Needed:**  
- **Compute:**  
  - GPU instances (NVIDIA A100 @ $3.06/hr)  
  - Distributed training clusters  
- **Storage:**  
  - Model artifacts registry (MLflow/DVC)  
  - Experiment tracking DB (Neptune/Weights&Biases)

### 3️⃣ **Model Serving & APIs**
**Components Needed:**  
| Component | Purpose | Cost Example |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| REST/GRPC Server | Handle prediction requests | AWS EC2 t3.medium @ $0.0416/hr |
| API Gateway | Route traffic & auth | AWS API Gateway @ $1.51/million reqs |
| Load Balancer | Distribute traffic | AWS ALB @ $0.0225/hr + $0.008/LCU-hour |
| Model Cache | Reduce inference latency | Redis Cloud @ $0.142/hr |

---

### 4️⃣ **Monitoring System**
**Essential Components:**  
```python
# Sample monitoring architecture
monitoring_stack = {
    'metrics_db': 'Prometheus',       # Free
    'logging': 'ELK Stack',           # ~$200/month
    'alerting': 'Grafana/PagerDuty',  # $10+/user/month
    'drift_detection': 'EvidentlyAI', # Open source
    'model_metrics': 'Arize'          # $500+/month
}
```

---

### 5️⃣ **Continuous Retraining**
**Infrastructure Needs:**  
- **Data Versioning:** DVC/Pachyderm ($0 if self-hosted)  
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Jenkins/ArgoCD ($0-$50/month)  
- **Auto-scaling Training:** Kubernetes cluster + Kubeflow

## Cost Breakdown by Component Type
| Component Type | Examples | Typical Cost Range |
|----------------|----------|--------------------|
| Compute        | GPU VMs, Spark clusters | $0.10-$15/hr |
| Storage        | S3 buckets, Feature Stores | $0-$0.50/GB-month |
| Networking     | API Gateways, Load Balancers | $10-$500/month |
| Monitoring     | Logging tools, APM systems | $0-$1000/month |

### Example End-to-End Flow
1. User → HTTPS API → API Gateway ($) → Load Balancer ($) → Model Container (**CPU/GPU**)   
2. Prediction → Monitoring Service (**Storage**) → Drift Detection (**Compute**)   
3. Retraining Trigger → Training Cluster (**GPU**) → Model Registry (**Storage**)  

This infrastructure enables full lifecycle management while requiring careful budgeting for cloud resources and tooling subscriptions.
